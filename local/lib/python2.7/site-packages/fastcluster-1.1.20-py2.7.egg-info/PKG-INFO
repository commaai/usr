Description: 
        This library provides Python functions for hierarchical clustering. It
        generates hierarchical clusters from distance matrices or from vector data.
        
        Part of this module is intended to replace the functions
        
            linkage, single, complete, average, weighted, centroid, median, ward
        
        in the module scipy.cluster.hierarchy with the same functionality but much
        faster algorithms. Moreover, the function 'linkage_vector' provides
        memory-efficient clustering for vector data.
        
        The interface is very similar to MATLAB's Statistics Toolbox API to make code
        easier to port from MATLAB to Python/Numpy. The core implementation of this
        library is in C++ for efficiency.
        
        Installation files for Windows are provided on `PyPI
        <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/fastcluster>`_ and on `Christoph Gohlke's web
        page <http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#fastcluster>`_.
        
        **The fastcluster package is considered stable and will undergo few changes
        from now on. If some years from now there have not been any updates, this
        does not necessarily mean that the package is unmaintained but maybe it just
        was not necessary to correct anything. Of course, please still report potential
        bugs and incompatibilities to daniel@danifold.net.**
